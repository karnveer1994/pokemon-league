Welcome to the Pokemon League!

The webapp is simple, you have three large panels, two on the left and one on the right.

On the right is a searchable online pokedex where you can Ô¨Ånd your pokemon and add it to your lineup.
On the top-left area there you will see your current lineup and their portraits.

On the bottom-left is where you can customize information about your selected Pokemon, movesets, favorite color, nickname, the forms are up to you.

Exam?



Wait I thought this was an exam to test my skills? Why am I suddenly a Pokemon trainer?
